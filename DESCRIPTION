Description: Implements a set of methodological tools
	     that enable researchers to apply matching methods to
	     time-series cross-sectional data. Imai, Kim, and Wang
	     (2018) <http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/tscs.pdf> 
	     proposes a nonparametric generalization of the
	     difference-in-differences estimator, which does not rely
	     on the linearity assumption as often done in
	     practice. Researchers first select a method of matching
	     each treated observation for a given unit in a
	     particular time period with control observations from
	     other units in the same time period that have a similar
	     treatment and covariate history. These methods include
	     standard matching methods based on propensity score and
	     Mahalanobis distance, as well as weighting methods. Once 
	     matching is done, both short-term and long-term average 
	     treatment effects for the treated can be estimated with 
	     standard errors. The package also offers a visualization 
	     technique that allows researchers to assess the quality 
	     of matches by examining the resulting covariate balance.
