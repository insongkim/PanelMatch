\title{get_set_treatment_effects}
\usage{
get_set_treatment_effects(pm.obj, data, lead)
}
\arguments{
\item{pm.obj}{an object of class \code{PanelMatch}}

\item{data}{data.frame with the original data}

\item{lead}{integer (or integer vector) indicating the time period(s) in the future for which the treatment effect size will be calculated. Calculations will be made for the period t + lead, where t is the time of treatment. If more than one lead value is provided, then calculations will be performed for each value.}
}
\value{
a list equal in length to the number of lead periods specified to the \code{lead} argument. Each element in the list is a vector of the matched set level effects.
}
\description{
Calculates the treatment effect size at the matched set level
}
\details{
Calculate the size of treatment effects for each matched set.
}
