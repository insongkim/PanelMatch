\item{...}{optional arguments to be passed to \code{hist()}}

\item{border}{default is NA. This is the same argument as the standard argument for \code{hist()}}

\item{col}{default is "grey". This is the same argument as the standard argument for \code{hist()}}

\item{ylab}{default is "Frequency of Size". This is the same argument as the standard argument for \code{hist()}}

\item{xlab}{default is "Matched Set Size". This is the same argument as the standard argument for \code{hist()}}

\item{lwd}{default is NULL. This is the same argument as the standard argument for \code{hist()}}

\item{main}{default is "Distribution of Matched Set Sizes". This is the same argument as the standard argument for \code{hist}}

\item{freq}{default is TRUE. See \code{freq} argument in \code{hist()} function for more.}

\item{include.empty.sets}{logical value indicating whether or not empty sets should be included in the histogram. default is FALSE. If FALSE, then empty sets will be noted as a separate vertical bar at x = 0. If TRUE, empty sets will be included as normal sets.}

\description{
A plot method for creating a histogram of the distribution of the sizes of matched sets.
This method accepts all standard optional \code{hist} arguments via the \code{...} argument.
By default, empty matched sets (treated units that could not be
matched with any control units) are noted as a vertical bar at x = 0 and not included in the
regular histogram. See the \code{include.empty.sets} argument for more information about this. If the quantity of interest is ATE, a plot will be returned for the matched sets associated with the att and the atc.
