\usage{
PanelEstimate(
  sets,
  number.iterations = 1000,
  df.adjustment = FALSE,
  confidence.level = 0.95,
  moderator = NULL,
  data
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sets}{A \code{PanelMatch} object attained via the
\code{PanelMatch} function.}

\item{number.iterations}{An integer value indicating the number of bootstrap
iterations. The default is 1000.}

\item{df.adjustment}{A logical value indicating whether or not a
degree-of-freedom adjustment should be performed for the standard error
calculation. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{confidence.level}{A numerical value specifying the confidence level and range of interval
estimates for statistical inference. The default is .95.}

\item{moderator}{The name of a moderating variable, provided as a character string. If a moderating variable is provided
the returned object will be a list of \code{PanelEstimate} objects. The names of the list will reflect the different values of the 
moderating variable. More specifically, the moderating variable values will be converted to syntactically proper names using 
\code{make.names}.}

\item{data}{The same time series cross sectional data set provided to the PanelMatch function used to produce 
the matched sets}
}
\value{
\code{PanelEstimate} returns a list of class
`PanelEstimate' containing the following components:
\item{estimates}{the point estimates of the quantity of interest for the lead periods specified}
\item{bootstrapped.estimates}{the bootstrapped point estimate values}
\item{bootstrap.iterations}{the number of iterations used in bootstrapping}
\item{method}{refinement method used to create the matched sets from which the estimates were calculated}
\item{lag}{See PanelMatch argument \code{lag} for more information.}
\item{lead}{The lead window sequence for which \code{PanelEstimate} is producing point estimates and standard errors.}
\item{confidence.level}{the confidence level}
\item{qoi}{the quantity of interest}
\item{matched.sets}{the refined matched sets used to produce the estimations}
\item{standard.error}{the standard error(s) of the point estimates}
}
\description{
\code{PanelEstimate} estimates a causal quantity of interest, including the average treatment effect for 
treated or control units (att and atc, respectively), or average treatment effect (ate), as specified in \code{PanelMatch}.
This is done by estimating the counterfactual outcomes for each treated unit using
matched sets. Users will provide matched sets that were obtained by the
\code{PanelMatch} function and obtain point estimates via a
weighted average computation with weighted bootstrap standard errors. Point estimates and standard errors will be 
produced for each period in the lead window specified by the \code{lead} argument from \code{PanelMatch}. 
Users may run multiple estimations by providing lists of each argument to the function. 
However, in this format, every argument must be explicitly specified in each configuration 
and must adhere to the same data types/structures outlined below. See the included code examples for more about 
how this functionality works.
