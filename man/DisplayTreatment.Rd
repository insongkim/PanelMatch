\arguments{
\item{unit.id}{Name of the unit identifier variable as a character string}

\item{time.id}{Name of the time identifier variable as a character string}

\item{treatment}{Name of the treatment variable as a character string}

\item{data}{data.frame that contains the time series cross sectional data used for matching and estimation. Unit and time data must be integers. Time data must also be formatted as sequential integers that increase by one.}

\item{color.of.treated}{Color of the treated observations provided as a character string (this includes hex values). Default is red.}

\item{color.of.untreated}{Color of the untreated observations provided as a character string (this includes hex values). Default is blue.}

\item{title}{Title of the plot provided as character string}

\item{xlab}{Character label of the x-axis}

\item{ylab}{Character label of the y-axis}

\item{x.size}{Numeric size of the text for xlab or x axis label. Default is 10. Assign x.size = NULL to use built in ggplot2 method of determining label size. 
When the length of the time period is long, consider setting to NULL and adjusting size and ratio of the plot.}

\item{y.size}{Numeric size of the text for ylab or y axis label. Default is 5. Assign y.size = NULL to use built in ggplot2 method of determining label size. 
When the number of units is large, consider setting to NULL and adjusting size and ratio of the plot.}

\item{legend.position}{Position of the legend. Provide this according to ggplot2 standards.}

\item{x.angle}{Angle (in degrees) of the tick labels for x-axis}

\item{y.angle}{Angle (in degrees) of the tick labels for y-axis}

\item{legend.labels}{Character vector of length two describing the
labels of the legend to be shown in the plot. ggplot2 standards are used.}

\item{decreasing}{Logical. Determines if display order should be increasing or decreasing by the amount of treatment received. Default is \code{decreasing} = FALSE.}

\item{matched.set}{a matched.set object (optional) containing a single treated unit and a set of matched controls. If provided, this set will be highlighted on the resulting plot.}

\item{show.set.only}{logical. If TRUE, only the treated unit and control units contained in the provided \code{matched.set} object will be shown on the plot. 
Default is FALSE. If no \code{matched.set} is provided, then this argument will have no effect.}

\item{hide.x.axis.label}{logical. If TRUE, x axis labels are not shown. Default is FALSE.}

\item{hide.y.axis.label}{logical. If TRUE, y axis labels are not shown. Default is FALSE.}

\item{gradient.weights}{logical. If TRUE, the "darkness"/shade of units in the provided \code{matched.set} object will be displayed according to their weight. Control units with higher weights will appear darker on the resulting plot. Control units with lower weights will appear lighter. This argument has no effect unless a \code{matched.set} is provided.}

\item{dense.plot}{logical. if TRUE, lines between tiles are removed on resulting plot. This is useful for producing more readable plots in situations where the number of units and/or time periods is very high.}
}
\value{
\code{DisplayTreatment} returns a treatment variation plot (using ggplot2),
which visualizes the variation of treatment across unit and time.
}
\description{
\code{DisplayTreatment} visualizes the treatment distribution
across units and time in a panel dataset
